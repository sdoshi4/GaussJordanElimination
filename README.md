# GaussJordanElimination
Gauss Jordan Elimination algorithm implemented in vanilla Python

Shaan Doshi 1/30/24

This is a Python implementation of Gauss-Jordan Elimination. In my math class (UIUC's Math 416: Abstract Linear Algebra, taught my Professor Dunfield), we went over the 6 steps of Gauss Jordan elimination (notes attached), and proved using induction that it always outputs a row-equivalent matrix to the input that is in RREF. I thought this was really cool, and decided to implement this using vanilla python to work for matrices stored in 2D arrays.
